For every project, you’ll do these 5 steps before writing anything:

Tiny Spec (10 lines max)

What does the program do?

What inputs? What outputs?

What rules?

When is it “done”?

State (the data that changes)
Ask: “What do I need to remember while the program runs?”

Actions (what can happen)
List actions like: “player chooses move”, “check winner”, “update score”, “save data”.

Rules (pure logic)
This is where most confidence comes from: rules should be testable without UI.

UI last
CLI or GUI is just how you press the buttons. Your logic stays the same.
